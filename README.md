# vue-hello-world package

Boilerplate package to use vue.js within atom.

## Install

Clone repository.

run
```sh
npm install

```

Link it to your packages folder.

## Notes
This package has a own [package reloader](https://github.com/paulpflug/atom-package-reloader) and [logger](https://github.com/paulpflug/atom-simple-logger) for faster developing, both aren't necessary.

It also depends on my own [vue component compiler](https://github.com/paulpflug/atom-vue-component-compiler) and [loader](https://github.com/paulpflug/atom-vue-component-loader) wrapper, these are very simple and could be replaced by own code.

The compiler could be fully replaced by my [vue-autocompile](https://github.com/paulpflug/vue-autocompile) package

For a full scale example package see the source of my [opened-files](https://github.com/paulpflug/opened-files) package
